            <P>Hi! We are a group of college students that gre frustrated with the wide array of school resources spread unevenly across the internet. Finding truly useful resources feels like a whole class in itself!
            This website is dedicated to preserving, organizing, and catalouging resources we and other college students have found useful in our university careers. If you think we are missing a resource that helped you in your college journey, let us know in our contact form!</P>
